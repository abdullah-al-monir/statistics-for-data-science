# Statistics for Data Science ðŸ“Š

Statistics is one of the most important parts of data science. It provides the essential tools to **describe data, understand patterns, and make informed decisions using numbers**. This module will explore different types of statistical tests and how they help us find meaning in data. By the end, you'll have the basic tools to analyze and compare data confidently.

## Introduction to Statistics and Data Summary

* **Foundation:** Start with the basics and understand why statistics is a key part of data science.
* **Core Concepts:**
    * Learn what statistics means and why it matters.
    * Understand how to describe and summarize data (i.e., **descriptive statistics**).
    * Explore **Bayesâ€™ Theorem** in simple terms (updating probability based on new evidence).
    * Learn how to measure linear relationships using **correlation** and **covariance**.

---

## Probability and Distributions

* **Uncertainty & Chance:** Understand how uncertainty and chance work in data.
* **Key Topics:**
    * Learn about different **probability distributions** like **Normal**, **Binomial**, and **Poisson**.
    * Understand the idea of **inferential statistics**, which involves using small data samples to make big guesses about a larger population.

---

## Central Limit Theorem and Hypothesis Testing

* **Checking Guesses:** See how large datasets behave and how to check your assumptions.
* **Core Topics:**
    * Understand the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** in simple wordsâ€”how sample means behave.
    * Learn what **hypothesis testing** is, including null/alternative hypotheses, and why itâ€™s used in data science.

---

## Z-test and T-test

* **Common Testing Methods:** Get introduced to two common methods for comparing means.
* **Key Focus:**
    * Learn when and how to use **Z-tests** and **T-tests**.
    * Compare both tests and understand the fundamental difference between them (e.g., population standard deviation knowledge).

---

## Chi-Square Test and ANOVA

* **Relationship Analysis:** Explore more ways to test if things are related, moving beyond simple mean comparisons.
* **Key Tests:**
    * Use the **Chi-Square ($\chi^2$) Test** to check if two categorical variables (or groups) are linked.
    * Learn about **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** to compare the means of **more than two groups** at once.

---

## Confidence Intervals and A/B Testing

* **Informed Estimation:** Learn to make better guesses using samples and applying tests.
* **Real-World Application:**
    * Understand **confidence intervals** and what they mean for estimating a population parameter.
    * Learn how **A/B testing** is used to compare two ideas (e.g., different versions of a website, ad, or product feature).

## Advanced Tests and Matrix Intro

* **Project Tools:** Finish the module with a few more advanced tools used in real-world data science projects.
* **Advanced Topics:**
    * Explore **MANOVA** (Multivariate ANOVA) and **Bayesian statistics**.
    * Learn how statistical tests aid in **feature selection** for machine learning models.
    * Get a quick introduction to **matrices** and linear algebra, which are essential for data processing.
